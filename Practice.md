## Questions

1. Write a program that calculates the power of a number (x^n) without using the built-in function. Define a method called CalculatePower that takes two parameters (x and n) and returns the result. 
2. Write a program to print the **Fibonacci series** up to a specified number of terms. Define a method called FibonacciSeries that takes an integer parameter (n) and prints the Fibonacci series up to the nth term. 

**What is a Fibonacci series?**
> The Fibonacci sequence is a type series where each number is the sum of the two that precede it. It starts from 0 and 1 usually. The Fibonacci sequence is given by 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, and so on. The numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are also called Fibonacci numbers.

3. Write a program that checks if a given number is an **Armstrong number.** Define a method called IsArmstrongNumber that takes an **integer** parameter and **returns true** if it's an Armstrong number, otherwise false.

**What is an Armstrong Number?**
> An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number, pluperfect digital invariant, or pluperfect number) is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. In other words, an n-digit number is an Armstrong number if the sum of its digits, each raised to the nth power, is equal to the number itself. 

**Example** 

> 153 is an Armstrong number. 

> 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153 

> 1634 is an Armstrong number. 

> 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4 = 1 + 1296 + 81 + 256 = 1634 


4. Implement a program that checks if a given number, is a **Perfect Number.** Define a method called IsPerfectNumber that takes an integer parameter and returns true if it's a perfect number, otherwise false. 

**What is a Perfect Number?**
> A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself. In other words, the sum of the positive divisors of a perfect number (excluding the number itself) equals the number. 


**Examples**

**6 is a perfect number.**

> Divisors of 6: 1, 2, 3 

> 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 

**28 is a perfect number.**

> Divisors of 28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 

> 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28 


5. Write a program to calculate the sum of prime numbers up to a given limit. Define a method called SumOfPrimes that takes an integer parameter (limit) and returns the sum of prime numbers.
